# 🚦 Smart Traffic Congestion Prediction & Route Optimization in Toronto

## Overview

This project presents a smart, data-driven approach to **predicting traffic congestion** and **optimizing driving routes** in Toronto. We combine **machine learning**, **weather data**, and **geospatial analysis** to deliver a predictive web application and visualization dashboard aimed at reducing traffic stress for commuters.

Developed as part of the AMOD 5410 course, the project utilizes **big data frameworks (Hadoop, Spark)** and modern ML techniques to create an intelligent urban mobility system.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict traffic levels (High, Medium, Low) on Toronto streets using historical data
- Incorporate weather data to improve prediction accuracy
- Optimize routes using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Visualize trends using Tableau
- Deploy the model for public inference via Hugging Face
- Provide a user-friendly web application for route planning
